This code creates a 2D list called "grid" that represents a grid of characters.

The grid is initialized with the characters "-", "#", and "#".

The code then uses nested for loops to iterate through the elements in the grid, and for each element that is equal to "-", the code replaces it with the value "0". 

The code then checks the adjacent elements (north, south, east, west, north-east, north-west, south-east, south-west) to see if they are equal to "#". 

If they are, it increments the value of the element by 1. The code then prints the updated grid and the indexes and elements. 

Finally, the code displays the new 2D list with the new assigned values for each "-"
